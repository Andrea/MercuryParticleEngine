# Mercury Particle Engine

Hi there, 
I've used Mercury a few times, enough times to know that the project doesn't seem to be under heavy development, this made me sad. So I decided to fork it and work on changes that I think it needs. If the original people from Mercury want to take over great!

# The plan
I can't really call this a roadmap, I think it falls under essential maintainance.

* Create the appropiate branches, Version 4.0 will have it's own branch. Will keep original tags (If you know a way please let me know)
* Build version 4.0 and offer assemblies. 
* Add nugget packages for the different platforms (Version 4.0 WP7 already in Downloads section)
